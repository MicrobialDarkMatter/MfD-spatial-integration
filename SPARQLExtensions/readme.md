# SPARQL Extensions

This folder contains functions that extend the functionality of SPARQL. These extensions are necessary for performing computations and comparisons between S2 cells.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide additional capabilities to SPARQL queries when working with S2 cells. These extensions enable complex spatial integration and analysis within the SPARQL query language.

## Contents

The folder currently contains the following files:

- `getS2BinaryID.js`: This file contains a JavaScript function that implements computing an S2 cell ID at a given level for a coordinate pair.

**TODO**: - `example_queries.sparql`: This file provides example SPARQL queries that demonstrate how to use the S2 cell functions in real-world scenarios.

## Usage

To implement these functions in a triple store ...
